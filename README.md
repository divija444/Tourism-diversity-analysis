# Tourism-diversity-analysis

This project investigates global tourism patterns using statistical modeling and interactive visualization. By introducing novel metrics like the **Tourism Diversity Index (TDI)** and **Category Potential Score (CPS)**, the project aims to identify underserved but high-potential tourism categories and destinations.

Developed as part of the **DSE 501: Statistics for Data Analysts** course at Arizona State University, this project combines rigorous statistical analysis, machine learning techniques, and dashboard design to support data-driven tourism development.

## Objectives

- Quantify the diversity and performance of tourism categories across countries.
- Identify factors influencing tourism revenue (visitor counts, ratings, infrastructure).
- Build a **content-based recommendation system** for tourist destinations.
- Visualize key insights through an interactive **Dashboard**.

## Key Features

- **Tourism Diversity Index (TDI):** Measures the variety of tourism categories in a country.
- **Category Potential Score (CPS):** Identifies high-growth tourism segments.
- **Hypothesis Testing & Regression Modeling:**  
  - Visitor count and rating as predictors of revenue  
  - Accommodation availability as a factor in visitor inflow  
  - Revenue correlation with TDI
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggests similar destinations using **cosine similarity**.
- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** Filter and explore insights by country, category, rating, and more.
